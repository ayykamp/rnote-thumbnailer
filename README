This is a camera raw thumbnailers for GNOME.

It will be used by Nautilus and other application supporting
thumbnailer to generate thumbnails from camera raw files.

It is now built in Rust and uses the Rust version of libopenraw.  It
depends on libopenraw to do most of the work and does extract previews
instead of processing the raw data. That makes it fast.

But depending on libopenraw mean that it might not support
all formats and might have bugs.

The source code is hosted on GNOME gitlab:

# Packaging

There is a `raw-thumbnailer.spec` file as an example of RPM
packaging.  While it was written for Fedora it is probably not up to
it standards (it uses vendora tarball). It was written to allow build
a RPM package for deployment. You can use it by putting the source
tarball in `~/rpmbuild/SOURCES` and then `rpmbuild -ba raw-thumbnailer.spec`.
