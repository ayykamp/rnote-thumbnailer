This is a camera raw thumbnailers for GNOME.

It will be used by Nautilus and other application supporting
thumbnailer to generate thumbnails from camera raw files.

It is now built in Rust and uses the Rust version of libopenraw.  It
depends on libopenraw to do most of the work and does extract previews
instead of processing the raw data. That makes it fast.

But depending on libopenraw mean that it might not support
all formats and might have bugs.
