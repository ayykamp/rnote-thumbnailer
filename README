This is a camera raw thumbnailers for GNOME.

It is now built in Rust and uses the Rust version of libopenraw.
It depends on libopenraw to do most of the work and does
extract previews instead of processing the raw data. That
makes it fast.

But depending on libopenraw mean that it might not support
all formats and might have bugs.
